# Technical Pillar Architecture

## Overview
The Technical Pillar serves as the systematic validation, reliability engineering, and technical implementation framework for the Qwen Profiler system.

## Definition
Systematic validation, reliability engineering, and technical implementation framework that ensures robust and reliable AI agent configurations.

## Boundaries
- **Infrastructure architecture and optimization**: Design and optimization of system infrastructure
- **Monitoring and observability implementation**: Implementation of monitoring and observability systems
- **Production system troubleshooting and debugging**: Troubleshooting and debugging of production systems
- **Systematic validation and quality assurance**: Systematic validation and quality assurance processes

## Responsibilities
- **Technical validation of agent configurations**: Validating AI agent configurations meet technical requirements
- **Reliability engineering and SRE practices**: Implementing Site Reliability Engineering practices
- **Implementation verification and testing**: Verifying and testing technical implementations
- **Performance monitoring and optimization**: Monitoring and optimizing system performance

## Core Components
